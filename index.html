<h3>
  Hi there!
  <br><br>
  This is a set of tutorials for getting started with iOS <i>and</i> Android
  app development using the fantastic <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">Ruby Motion</a>.
  <br><br>
  These tutorials are for absolute beginners who know the basics of Ruby and
  little else.
  To get started, just click on the links below and follow along as I build basic apps
  and explore the Android and iOS APIs with you. These tutorials will be most effective
  if you don't just read along! I want you to be writing code, clicking links, and
  digging deeper as we go.
  <br><br>
  If you find that anything is amiss such as broken links, broken code,
  or confusing writing, please let me know! This is an open-source project
  so I'd love to have all the help I can get.
  <br><br>
  I don't have a solid plan for how these tutorials will ultimately be organized,
  so for now I'm going to dig into iOS and Android separately.

<!-- Generate Tutorial Links -->
<!-- First, create an array of the tutorials by splitting a string, and get all the pages -->
{% assign categories = "android-start ios-start" | split: ' ' %}
{% assign pages = site.pages | sort:'order' %}

<!-- Next go through each category and create its links -->
{% for category in categories %}
  <!-- Now find the title of this category and put it as a header -->
  {% for page in pages %}
    {% if page.category == category %}
      <h2>
        {{ page.category-title }}
      </h2>
      {% break %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}

  <!-- With the title in place, find all the pages that belong to this category and link'em up -->
  <div class="trigger">
    {% for page in pages %}
    {% if page.category == category %}
    <div>
      <a class="page-link" href="{{ page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
    </div>
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
