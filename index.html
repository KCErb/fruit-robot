<h1> Hi there! </h1>
<h3>
  This is a set of simple tutorials for getting started with iOS <i>and</i> Android
  app development using the fantastic <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">RubyMotion</a>.
  <br><br>
  To get started, just click on the links below and follow along as I build basic apps
  and explore the Android and iOS APIs with you. These tutorials will be most effective
  if you don't just read along! I want you to be writing code, clicking links, and
  digging deeper as we go.
  <br><br>
  They are still under construction, so if you find that anything is amiss such as broken links, broken code,
  or confusing writing, please let me know! This is an <a href="https://github.com/KCErb/fruit-robot">open-source</a> project
  so I'd love to have all the help I can get!
