# Starting with iOS

The following tutorials are based on the native iOS tutorials found [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/RoadMapiOS/index.html).

As with the Android lessons, the goal here is to get familiar with iOS development *before* you get familiar with RubyMotion development.

That said, we can't move forward until you've got your RubyMotion ducks in a row. To do that, follow the instructions over at [the RubyMotion website]() and make sure you can get the example `Hello` app running before you move on.
