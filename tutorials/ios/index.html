    Introduction
  </h2>
  <h3>
    These tutorials will walk through some of the iOS developer trainings found <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/navigation/">here</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the first tutorial (Starting with iOS), we'll use vanilla RubyMotion to help you get your bearings. After
    that, we'll take a quick run through some important tools that improve on the vanilla
    RubyMotion development experience. And finally we'll chug through some trainings using
    using those tools and taking occasional detours as needed. Enjoy!

<!-- Generate Tutorial Links -->
<!-- First, create an array of the tutorials by splitting a string,
 and get all the pages. We do this to enforce an order on the categories
 There's probably a cleaner way, but I'll cross that bridge when I have more
 than two lessons to think about -->
{% assign categories = "start toolbox" | split: ' ' %}
{% assign pages = site.pages | sort:'order' %}

<!-- Next go through each category and create its links -->
{% for category in categories %}
  <!-- Now find the title of this category and put it as a header -->
  {% for page in pages %}
    {% if page.category == category %}
      <h2>
        {{ page.category-title }}
      </h2>

      <h3>
        {{ page.category-description }}
      </h3>
      {% break %}
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}

  <!-- With the title in place, find all the pages that belong to this category and link'em up -->
  <div class="trigger">
    {% for page in pages %}
    {% if page.category == category and page.os == "ios" %}
    <div>
      <a class="page-link" href="{{ page.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">{{ page.title }}</a>
    </div>
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
