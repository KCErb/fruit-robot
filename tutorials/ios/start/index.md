# Starting with iOS

The following tutorials are meant to mirror [the Android tutorials](http://kcerb.github.io/fruit-robot/tutorials/android/) available from this website.
My hope is that by introducing the two together, differences and similarities can be easier to follow and the student will be better prepared to write cross-platform apps.

As with the Android lessons, the goal here is to get familiar with iOS development *before* you get familiar with RubyMotion development.

That said, we can't move forward until you've got your RubyMotion ducks in a row. To do that, follow the instructions over at [the RubyMotion website](http://www.rubymotion.com/developers/guides/manuals/cocoa/getting-started/) and make sure you can get the example `Hello` app running before you move on (through section 6.1).
