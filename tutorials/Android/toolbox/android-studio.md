The next tool I'm going to introduce you to is Android Studio. To be honest, I'm not sure how much I'll be using Android Studio when it comes to actual app development! I've decided to include it because I hear it referenced often on StackOverflow and I've heard that we can use it to build those layout XMLs instead of typing everything by hand. So let's explore around a little.

## Download

The first thing you've got to do is download Android Studio from the [Android developer's site](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html). While you're there you might want to read around a little. In this lesson, I only plan to play with the GUI / XML features so don't get too hung up on the details here.

When you open the app for the first time, you'll be asked to install the SDK, agree to license agreements etc. If you're here in the tutorials then you should already have a lot of the things it's downloading and installing. Oh well, put on a 5 minutes Youtube video and wait it out.
