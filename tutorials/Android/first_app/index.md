# Building Your First App

Welcome to Android app development with Ruby Motion!
Before we get going,
we need to make sure you're up and running with RubyMotion. Please head over
to the RubyMotion website and run through their [Getting Started](http://www.rubymotion.com/developers/guides/manuals/android/getting-started/) manual (if you haven't already done so).

If you get hung-up on the guides you might want to check out this list of [gotchas](https://gist.github.com/alxjrvs/4b73771294ea25feb2f7).

If you *have* already done that, and you've got everything up and running already,
then just be sure to run a quick

    $ sudo motion update

before we move on so that we're all on the same page.

## A Note on Sweat

I want to see you sweat.

I want to see you work a little at learning these things for yourself, but I don't want to see you give up because you're overwhelmed.

In this first lesson we're not going to use any of the awesome tools available for making life easier in Android! The reason for this is that I want to introduce you to the basics of Android without anything getting in the way. After we've walked through a basic app like this, the very first thing we'll do is get familiar with the 3rd party tools that make Android development more Ruby-like and human-friendly.

Throughout these tutorials, I'll try to explain some things and leave others up to you. If you find I've missed the balance
and some parts are *too* frustrating or unhelpful, please let me know! My ultimate goal for this website is to make learning app development as fun and easy as learning Ruby was.
