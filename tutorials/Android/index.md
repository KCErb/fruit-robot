# Building Your First App

Welcome to Android app development with Ruby Motion!
Before we get going,
we need to make sure you're up and running with motion. Please head over
to the RubyMotion website and run through their [Getting Started](http://www.rubymotion.com/developers/guides/manuals/android/getting-started/) manual (if you haven't already done so).

If you get hung-up on the guides you might want to check out this list of [gotchas](https://gist.github.com/alxjrvs/4b73771294ea25feb2f7).

If you *have* already done that, and you've got everything up and running already,
then just be sure to run a quick

    $ sudo motion update

before we move on so that we're all on the same page.

OK, is that working? Everything good? Let's move on!
